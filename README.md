#Project Background
Ytchyâ€™s Lomi Hauz relies heavily on a manual system for tracking ingredient stocks,
and the current process has proven to be inefficient and error prone. The owner, Mr. Richard
Arguelles, faces challenges in manually checking and monitoring the quantity of ingredients in
stock, leading to instances where critical ingredients run low or are overlooked. This has
resulted in disruptions to production schedules, occasional stockouts, and the potential for
compromised product quality.
